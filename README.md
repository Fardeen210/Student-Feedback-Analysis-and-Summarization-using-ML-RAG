# Student-Feedback-Analysis-and-Summarization-using-BERTopic.
This project aims to analyze student feedback on assignments using sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and BERTopic. 

### **Problem Statement:**  
Understanding student experiences and feedback on assignments is challenging due to the large volume of responses. Manually analyzing reviews for sentiment, key concerns, and improvement suggestions is time-consuming and inefficient.  

### **Solution:**  
A system that collects structured and unstructured feedback through surveys, analyzes sentiment, extracts key insights, and generates summaries. It provides visualizations for sentiment distribution and highlights important phrases. Additionally, a retrieval-based model allows querying specific insights from the feedback.  

### **Techniques:**  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Categorizing responses as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Identifying frequently mentioned words and phrases.  
- **Summarization:** Generating concise reports on student feedback.  
- **Visualization:** Presenting insights using charts and word highlights.
